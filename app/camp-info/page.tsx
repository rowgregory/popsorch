              We started Camping With the Pops in 2018 to provide high school and college instrumental music students
              the opportunity to continue their musical development during the summer.

              Last year, over 60 students, coached by musicians from the Pops Orchestra and music educators,
              participated in a week-long camp performing in ensembles that included a string ensemble, a woodwind
              ensemble, low brass ensemble, a saxophone choir, a percussion ensemble, and a jazz band. The week
              concluded with a stirring student recital open to the public.
