                Having worked with dozens of tribute and guest artists to marry the popular music genre with symphonic
                orchestrations, Robyn fills concert halls with patrons and the soundtracks of their lives. Her dynamic
                personality, musical presence, and precise baton technique keep enthusiastic audience and orchestra
                members engaged, enthralled, and entertained from the first rehearsal to the final performance.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Specializing at the intersection of popular music and symphonic orchestrations, Robyn has developed,

                Neil Diamond, George Harrison, John Denver, the Four Seasons, Barry Manilow, Elvis Presley, the Beatles,
                Frank Sinatra, Barbra Streisand, the Beach Boys, Michael Bubl√©, and more.
